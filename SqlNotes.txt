1. SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT.

2.Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
3.SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

4.Return all the columns from the Customers table:

SELECT * FROM Customers;

5.The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
